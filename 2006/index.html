            A Central Processing Unit is also called a processor, central processor, or microprocessor. It carries out all the important functions of a computer. It receives instructions from both the hardware and active software and produces output accordingly. It then performs calculations, manipulates data, and produces output based on those instructions. It stores all important programs like operating systems that manage the computer's resources and allows you to interact with it and application software that you use to perform tasks like word processing, web browsing, and gaming. Your computer couldn't execute these essential programs without the CPU. 
            CPU also helps Input and output devices to communicate with each other. The CPU translates these inputs when you click, move the mouse, or click on a key on the keyboard, and it works with the relevant software program to produce the intended result. The CPU ensures that the input and output devices communicate without any troubles, whether it means printing a paper, playing music through the audio system, or showing text on the display screen. Owing to these features of CPU, it is often referred to as the brain of the computer.
            CPU is installed or inserted into a CPU socket located on the motherboard. Furthermore, it is provided with a heat sink to absorb and dissipate heat to keep the CPU cool and functioning smoothly.
